# MassBunk

This project provides a voting platform for students to plan a mass bunk.
A student  may create a poll for a mass bunk which will be informed to others in the class by a mail.
They may vote in favour or against it and after a deadline specified by the poll creator, the final result will be mailed to the students.
In case of a successfull bunk , the professor will also be informed so that he may plan his future classes accordingly.
